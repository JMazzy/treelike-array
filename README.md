# Tree-like Array in Ruby
An exercise to create a tree structure in an array using Ruby! 
- Fill in the methods in the file in the lib folder
- Contains Rspec tests. Make them pass!

I presented this to the class as a data structure challenge problem as part of Viking Code School.

For my solution to this problem, please see my heap implementation (https://github.com/JMazzy/ruby-heap-and-heapsort).
